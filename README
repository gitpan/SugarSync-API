SugarSync-API
=============

This is an experimental though function API for the SugarSync cloud
file storage service.

Functions provided are: authorization, getting data, handling
collections and files.

An example script performs a mirror of an extrernal share, showing
most of the basic functions.

Note that the SugarSync https protocol is slow, on average 1 call per
second. Processing a 6000 file share will take almost two hours.
